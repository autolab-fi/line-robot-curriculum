# Lesson 7. Speed record challenge


## Lesson objective
Reinforce the material learnt and complete the challenge. 

## Introduction
In this lesson, you will have a challenging task you need to write a program for the robot that the robot moves at an average speed of no less than ? km/h for a duration of ? seconds.

## Block of theory
You can easily find the average speed of the robot by knowing the total distance it traveled and the time it took to cover that distance. The average speed is then calculated as `speed = distance/time`.

For example, if the robot traveled **3 meters**, which is equivalent to **0.003 km**, in **5 seconds**, which is equivalent to **0.0014 hours**, then the average speed of the robot would be **av. speed = 0.003/0.0014 = 2.14 km/h** or **av. speed=3/5=0.6 m/s**.


## Task 
Write a program for the robot to make it move at at an average speed of no less than ? km/h for a duration of ? seconds. The robot at this task can only **move forward, turn right and left**.  

Think of a route for the robot.


## Conclusion
Congratulations! It was a challenging task, but you managed to complete it! In the next lessons, we will work with the LEDs installed on the robot.
