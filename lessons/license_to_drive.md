# Lesson 2. License to drive

## Lesson objective
Independently write a program for the robot and upload it for verification.

## Introduction
In this lesson we are giving you the driver's license: today, you will be writing the program on your own, without the instructor's help. However, first, let's cover some theory. We will talk about one of the most important concepts in programming: functions.


## Block of theory
In the previous lesson, we used the `lineRobot` library, and we will continue using it in the future. It contains functions for controlling the robot, allowing us to easily set our robot in motion. 

**Functions** are named blocks of code that perform specific task. It is mean that when you invoke a function, it performs a specific action, such as multiplying two numbers or displaying a message on the console. Some functions have **parameters**, for example `function(param1, param2)` has two parameters `param1` and `param2`. Parameters allows you pass data into function and work with it. In future lessons you will write your own functions for controlling robot.

We have already used the function `robot.moveForwardSeconds(seconds)`. This function makes the robot move forward, and the parameter `seconds` sets the duration of the movement in seconds.

## Task 
Write a program for the robot to make it drive straight for 5 seconds. You can go back to the previous lesson to recall how to set the robot in motion. Good luck!



## Conclusion
Congratulations! You have written your own program for robot movement! In the next lesson, we will explore the robot's movement in different directions using the library.
