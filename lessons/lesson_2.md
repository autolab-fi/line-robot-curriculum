# Lesson 2. License to drive

## Lesson objective
Independently write a program for the robot and upload it for verification.

## Introduction
In this lesson we will give you a license to drive, if you write a program for the robot by your own. We will talk about one of the most important concepts in programming: functions. Afterward, you will have a task to complete on your own. Good luck!


## Block of theory
In the previous lesson, we used the `lineRobot` library, and we will continue using it in the future. It contains functions for controlling the robot, allowing us to easily set our robot in motion. 

**Functions** are named blocks of code that perform specific task. It is mean that when you invoke a function, it performs a specific action, such as multiplying two numbers or displaying a message on the console. Some functions have **parameters**, for example `function(param1, param2)` has two parameters `param1` and `param2`. Parameters allows you pass data into function and work with it. In future lessons you will write your own functions for controlling robot.

We have already used the function `robot.moveForwardSeconds(seconds)`. This function makes the robot move forward, and the parameter `seconds` sets the duration of the movement in seconds.

## Task 
Write a program for the robot to make it drive straight for 5 seconds. You can go back to the previous lesson to recall how to set the robot in motion. 



## Conclusion
Congratulations! You have written your own program for robot movement! In the next lesson, we will explore the robot's movement in different directions using the library.
