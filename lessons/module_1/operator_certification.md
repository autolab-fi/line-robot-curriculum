## Overview
This certification lesson evaluates students' mastery of basic rover operations. Successful completion certifies the student as a qualified rover operator for basic Mars exploration tasks.

## Learning Objectives
- Demonstrate mastery of basic controls
- Execute complex movement sequences
- Handle emergency situations
- Maintain proper documentation

## Required Equipment
- Mars rover simulator
- Certification course setup
- Performance monitoring system
- Documentation tools

## Theoretical Background

### 1. Certification Requirements
- Movement precision
- Command mastery
- Emergency protocols
- Documentation standards

### 2. Performance Metrics
- Movement accuracy
- Time efficiency
- Error handling
- Resource management

### 3. Documentation Standards
- Operation logging
- Error reporting
- Performance tracking
- Maintenance records

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: Certification Course Setup
```cpp
#include <marsRover.h>

void setup() {
    // Initialize certification sequence
    rover.startCertification();
    
    // Verify systems
    rover.performSystemCheck();
    
    // Begin logging
    rover.startPerformanceLog();
}

void loop() {
    // Monitor performance
    rover.monitorPerformance();
    
    // Log results
    rover.logResults();
}
```

### Exercise 2: Complex Movement Sequence
```cpp
// Execute certification movement pattern
rover.moveWithPrecision(30, FORWARD);
rover.rotateWithPrecision(90, RIGHT);
rover.moveWithPrecision(20, FORWARD);
rover.performEmergencyStop();
```

### Exercise 3: Emergency Procedures
