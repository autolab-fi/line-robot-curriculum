		10.2) "City Competitions" - Completing a lap in a specific time to secure a sponsor or join the best team. For example, choosing their emblem and displaying it on an LED matrix or something similar, displayed in the student's profile. It may be something else for the purpose of winning competitions.

11) Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) Controller
	Lessons and exercises:
		11.1) "PID Controller" - Working principle, function for staying on the track using a PID controller, completing a lap using the PID controller
		11.2) "World Championship" - Completing a lap in the best time to win the Best Racer Cup


12) Smart City
	Lessons and exercises:
		12.1) "Crossroads" - Decision-making at crossroads
		12.2) "How Many crossroads here?" / "Way Home" - Task: Reach a point following the lines, choosing the correct direction at crossroads. Simply calculate the point based on x and y. Use the information to determine the next turn.
		12.3) "Keep in line" - robot should keep in line between two black lines.

13) Additional Challenges and ideas
	Lessons and exercises:
		13.1) "Real-Time Navigation" - Navigate through a labyrinth or a specific route in real-time (I think, that task 7.2 better)
		13.2) "Automatic Transmission" - Gradually accelerating while controlling in real-time
		13.3) "Mechanical Transmission" - Program buttons to shift gears, corresponding to specific speed ranges, allowing shifting only at certain speeds. All in real-time.
		13.4) "Navigator" - Create a library or write a program considering street parameters, their lengths, and names, and enable route planning using a graph (just an idea). Generate commands for the robot, such as "go straight," "turn right at this crossroad," "turn left at the next crossroad," and so on.
		*13.5) "Escape from labyrinth" - Escape from a labyrinth as a multi-lesson cycle: find the exit by systematically checking all squares, program an exit strategy using the right-hand rule. Additional map required
		*13.6) "Challenge from Racer Vasya/Petya/Bob, etc." - A new challenging route that the robot must complete within a given minimum time. Additional map required
		13.7) "Road Maintenance" - A section of the track is missing, represented by a gap in the black surface, and the robot must continue moving along the track.
		13.8) "Dangerous Section" / "Pedestrian Crossing" - The lines change to transverse lines, indicating a reduced speed zone, and the robot should slow down on this section and not lose its way.
		13.9) "Advanced Route" - A challenging track with various obstacles. The task is to travel from Point A to Point B, with the option to choose the route. A similar map could be used for various types of challenges, such as the one found at http://roboturnir.by/arkhiv/iv_tournament/race_line/
		13.10) "Color Inversion" / "Multi-Day Journey" / "Nighttime Road" - Along the route, the colors on the map are inverted ("Nightfall" example on the website http://roboturnir.by/arkhiv/iv_tournament/race_line/). The task for the robot is to continue moving.

14) LED Matrix (in case it is available, it can replace some LED-related tasks)
	Lessons and exercises:

		14.2) "Countdown" / "READY, SET, GO" - Displaying a countdown on the matrix before starting the robot.
		14.3) "Animation" - Animation sequence for robot startup. For example, an animation where the "power symbol" lights up.
		14.4) "Message Display" / "Sponsor Advertisement" / "Scrolling Text" - Displaying text as a scrolling message using library functions. Also providing character codes to allow students to display their own messages, such as their names.
